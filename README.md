# Clojure Learning

This is my learning process for clojure. First I have followed the [Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/) book.

## Getting started

You will need to install JRE, [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), and calva for VSCode.

Next you will use the following command

```{Bash}
lein new app clojure-noob
```
